My lab1 is a seabed world. There are fishes and jellyfishes in the sea, with some blue and white bubbles around.

Lab1: I Learn how to create a main scene and other scenes like nested scene. I learn how to create a new node for images that want to use mutipule times. 
Also learn how to change the setting like position, size, color of image. And we need to put our image near by the x0,y0 postion.
