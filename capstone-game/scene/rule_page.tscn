You are a famous picture book artist. You paint vivid worlds and give life into characters in your books. But one day, when you creating your story, something strange happened. Your imagination stuttered and the story began to unravel.

So you drew a new character, and used the power of ink to control this character into the world of book to find the truth.

You found story-eaters, born from forgotten drafts. They were jealous of your satisfied stories and stole the pieces of the story.

Each time you use the character's special ability drains the ink power. If you get hurt, you'd lose control of the character and back to the real world."
